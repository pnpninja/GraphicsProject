This project has 4 files,

  * Scaling.c
  * TranslationRotation.c
  * NoLineClipping.c
  * LineClipping.c


The project has been compiled on CodeBlocks where the GL library files are included in the source path.
The first four programs can also be executed in Linux using these:

    gcc -o <filename> <source-code file> -lm -lGLU -lglut -lGL

The first three programs takes input from the user a rectangle and the scaling factor, rotation angle and the translating factor and gives the desired output.
